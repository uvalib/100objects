                Is “100 Objects” enough? Absolutely not. From the exhibition’s earliest planning phase,
                we’ve heard cries of protest that something essential is missing from the list.
            </p>

                If you could add an item to this exhibition, what would it be? A famous monument on
                Grounds? A document in the archives describing an incident of great significance?
