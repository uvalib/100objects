why: "Australian Aboriginal artist Judy Watson (Waanyi) created a series of six limited edition prints titled \"experimental beds\" after undertaking a residency at UVA’s Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection. The title of this work comes from Jefferson’s penchant for planting seeds from around the world to see if they would thrive at Monticello. For Watson, the title also encompassed “Jefferson’s pursuits across the cultural divide ‘between the sheets’ with the enslaved woman, Sally Hemings” and the children and descendants that resulted from this. In many ways Watson’s family resembles Jefferson’s. She is descended from a line of Aboriginal women who married and had children with white men. Watson identifies the stories of enslaved workers escaping and living on the run and enslaved families separated by their owners with those of her grandmother and great-grandmother who were made to work on Queensland cattle stations by the Protector of Aborigines. It wasn’t until 1967, when Judy Watson was eight years old, that Australian citizenship was extended to all Aboriginal people through a constitutional amendment. Superimposed on Thomas Jefferson’s architectural drawings of UVA’s Rotunda, Watson uses silhouettes of Aboriginal artist Richard Bell and Lindsey Jackson, an African American dancer who lives in Brisbane. At Monticello Watson saw silhouettes of Jefferson’s white family members and American Indian chiefs who visited Jefferson in 1806. The pairing of Bell and Jackson, as contemporary people for whom history is as much a part of them as their DNA (indicated by fine traces of hair in the background), communicates Watson’s message about the parallel experiences of Indigenous Australians and African Americans. Watson developed ideas for this body of work with students in UVA’s studio art department in 2011. Jefferson’s architectural drawings were accessed through the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, which purchased a set of the prints. This print, experimental beds #1, was also acquired by the Library."
