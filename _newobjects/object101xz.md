next_object: "The statue of Thomas Jefferson in front of the Rotunda"
why: "White Supremacists, led by Richard Spencer, rallied on the front steps of the Rotunda, chanting the phrases “Jew will not replace us” and “blood and soil”. Thomas Jefferson’s statue, a symbol of white supremacy, is what drew them to this location. Although Jefferson’s statue stands before the Rotunda in honor of his contributions to this University, placing him on the pedestal served as an invitation for a more insidious narrative. I propose we continue to honor Jefferson's memory by dedicating this statue as the 101st object, off his pedestal, and within the context of his legacy as a white supremacist."
