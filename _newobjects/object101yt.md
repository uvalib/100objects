next_object: "Thomas Jefferson's slave's diary"
why: "It would provide the honest perspective of how Thomas Jefferson treated his slaves, which may shed light on how we perceive him to this day, in modern political context. It may also reveal Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s plans for the university by providing the personal perspective of one who built it with his own hands. Finally, if Thomas Jefferson's treatment of his slaves aligns with the positive narrative perpetuated today, it may be interesting to read whether the slave(s) themselves recognized the discrepancy between their treatment and of those belonging to other slaveowners."
