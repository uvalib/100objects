why: "Ern Commons is named after Ernie Been, UVA’s former Dean of Admissions and Vice President of Student Affairs. During his tenure in higher education, he was not only an influential player in admitting UVA's first black students, but also UVA's first class of women. He also fought for better financial opportunity at the University by advocating for lessening student loans and helping to do so through AccessUVA which was released after his retirement. If we are to reflect upon UVA's past 200 years, we must not forget that objects can only reflect so much culture. People can not only symbolize mindsets, beliefs, and hopes in their character, but also milestones in their work. Ernie Ern's legacy is recognized in the naming of buildings, student achievement awards, and in the stories people and administrators still pass around at UVA. He’s a testament to both UVA’s history and the progression it wanted for the future."
