next_object: "A Number One Bodo’s Ticket"
why: "Getting the number one Bodo’s ticket at least once during their time at UVA is a goal of many students; the feat consistently makes an appearance on the list of things for 4th years to do before they graduate. The ticket also signifies the institution of Bodo’s in general, a favorite place on the corner for student’s to stop for a bite to eat. Bodo’s can also be found all over Grounds: given out on the Lawn by various student organizations, provided as a gameday breakfast option for the Cavalier Marching Band, offered as an incentive to come to CIO interest meetings, etc."
