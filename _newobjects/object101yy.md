next_object: "#1 Bodo's Ticket"
why: "Going to bodos is something nearly every student on grounds does. The drive to get the #1 ticket extends across divides in the student body. The practice is fun, communal, and wholly original to Charlottesville. Adding something unique from the students perspective would be a great addition to the collection."
