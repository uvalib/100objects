next_object: "The banner held by student counter-protestors on August 11. "
why: "The despicable events of August 11th and 12th put Charlottesville and UVA in the national spotlight. We were invaded by hatred and bigotry, but our community banded together to support minorities. In this past year, we’ve used our privilege as students and faculty of the University to speak out against white supremacy and neo-Nazism. The most powerful display of solidarity took place on the night of August 11th: a group of students gathered under Mr. Jefferson’s statue and held up a banner that said “VA Students Act Against White Supremacy,” surrounded by violent, torch-wielding white supremacists. I think the inclusion of this banner as the 101st object in the exhibit would best represent the current chapter of the University's history."
