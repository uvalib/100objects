next_object: "An article of clothing/wardrobe from one of the first female students at UVa, paired next to the same garment from one of the first male students. "
why: "Personally I believe that the purpose of history is to help us learn for the future. By including an article of clothing from one of the first female students and putting it next to a similar garment from one of the first male students, the contrast in style will be striking. The men's clothing will be obviously outdated, but the women's clothing will be surprisingly fashionable. This will all bring attention to an important fact of UVa's history, that it was not very long ago that women were not allowed to attend. The hope then is that such an object will help us think about the ways that we discriminate and think in a backwards way even today."
