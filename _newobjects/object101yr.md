why: "The 101st object—and also the 102nd object—should remind us of Charlottesville on August 11-12, 2017. To do this, Special Collections should put two objects in conversation: a Unite the Right tiki torch and a counter-protester’s sign which reads, “No Nazis, No KKK, No Fascist USA.”   The objects’ captions should detail how UVA came to serve as the stage for a nationally significant, cultural confrontation—perhaps making the obvious connection to alumnus Richard Spencer.   While these objects would make for an undoubtedly provocative display, they could serve as a way of prompting museum-goers to consider something that is far from limited to last August: how UVA relates to the past. On a higher note, the caption might also comment on the University’s resolve in the face of those who seek to divide us."
