next_object: "Sheet music of the Good Old Song"
why: "The Good Old Song has been around for over a century, and its lyrics have become a hallmark of almost any UVa event. The camaraderie that is sparked each time the UVa community locks arms and sings the alma mater is unparalleled. Almost all current UVa students and alums can hit every note of the Good Old Song, and I think its true importance to the University should be cemented into this exhibition."
