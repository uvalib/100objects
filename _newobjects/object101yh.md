next_object: "A student’s counter-protest poster from the August 11th rally"
why: "The events that happened last August will without a doubt be remembered and imbedded in the memory of UVA. I think adding a poster, or some other artifact from the rally, will help to shed light on what UVA stands for. It demonstrates the necessity for democracy, and the universities encouragement of student activism and free speech. It’s such a tumultuous time in Charlottesville and across the country, I feel as though it’s important to document these historic moments. Rather than trying to forget what happened in August, we should remember it and use it as a guide for our future, so that we may work to make UVA and Charlottesville a safe and welcoming place for everyone."
