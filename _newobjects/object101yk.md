next_object: "A collection of Student ID's throughout the years"
why: "If I could add an object to the 100 objects from the University of Virginia, I would add a collection of Student ID’s throughout the years of UVA. The collection could be presented on a board or a book that demonstrates the timeline. As a current first year at UVA, I need my student ID with me constantly. As I need it to enter my dorm and for my meals daily, it is a constant and necessary part of my everyday life at the University. I think these ID’s represent our lives as well as puts a face to the students over time. The collection can demonstrate increasing diversity, or lack thereof, and can also include influential students. I believe a collection at of students IDs would be an impactful addition to the exhibit."
