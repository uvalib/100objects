why: "His grave shows us how history has a weird way of cropping back up again. Edwin Alderman was the president of Virginia who not only graciously received money from the KKK, but spoke at the welcome ceremony of the Robert E. Lee statue that sits down in Emancipation Park. UVa must not forget its racist roots if it hopes to understand our current situation."
