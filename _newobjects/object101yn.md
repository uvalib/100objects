next_object: "brick from Brooks Hall"
why: "I think this object matters because the University is discussing whether or not to tear down Brooks Hall because it doesn't match the other buildings on grounds (Curatorâ€™s note: Never fear, dear readers! We are glad to inform you that Brooks Hall has landmark status and is not at risk of being torn down, though a few decades ago there was indeed a call to demolish it. We are glad to report that the University recently performed significant repairs to the structure, ensuring that it will remain intact for the foreseeable future).  I personally like the building because it stands out and has character.  This building is a piece of UVA's history and I think a brick from this building would be a great memoir.  In the describing caption we could say what the building was used for in the past to give more background."
