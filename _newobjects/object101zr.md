why: "Though I came to UVa as a student after the Pep Band's demise, I grew up a faculty-child and fondly remember the spirit that the Pep Band brought to UVa. One of a handful of college scramble bands, the Pep Band may have been controversial but there's no doubt in my mind the group contributed great value and uniqueness to UVa's community during its 30 years."
