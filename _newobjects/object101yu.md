next_object: "An original menu from The Virginian on the Corner"
why: "The Virginian has been on the corner since 1923 and still remains a popular place for students to eat. I think that there was not a prevalent presence of what student life is like and adding something historic form the corner would help show other parts of the university life that are not strictly affiliated with the university. Adding the first menu would not only show the history of the corner being part of student life, but it would also be relevant to today because both students and professors still eat there today."
