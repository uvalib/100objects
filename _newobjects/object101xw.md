next_object: "A recording of the chapel bells tolling  seven times upon the death of a Seven Society member"
why: "I had the opportunity to hear this discordant chime played several times during my years as a student.  I remember walking across Grounds and stopping to listen to the hallowed sound.  To me it signified the rich history and dedication of the  individual who faithfully served the University while also reminding those hearing the sound that despite the loss, new members will continue in service."
