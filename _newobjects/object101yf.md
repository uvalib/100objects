why: "When I think about my four years here, one event that always sticks out is the Rolling Stone article from Fall of 2014. This was my first semester at school, and I vividly remember reading the article in the dining hall because everyone around me was doing the same thing. Some people were crying, some looked shocked, some looked angry. But the reason that I’m not suggesting we add the magazine itself, is because what's more striking to me than that moment are all the moments that followed to make sure nothing like that happens again. Green Dot launched the following semester as an initiative to prevent power based personal violence like sexual assault. The bystander trainings was empowering and inspirational, and terms like “green dot” and “red dot” have truly been integrated into the UVA rhetoric. When I think about UVA, I think about a resilient community, not one of fear and shame. That's why I think the best way to represent this important moment in UVA’s history is with the powerful way we chose to respond."
