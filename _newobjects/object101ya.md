why: "As the University community was still reeling from the events of August 11th and 12th, the Black Students Alliance on Grounds issued a list of ten demands, simply known at the “BSA Demands,” that aimed have the administration take steps to both acknowledge the University’s history with white supremacy and increase representation of people of color within the student body and among faculty. While many of the demands have yet to be implemented, they represent important efforts to get the University Community to confront the prejudice that has existed, and in many ways continues to exist, on Grounds, something that I hope will mark a new era in the University’s history. The fact that it comes on the 200th anniversary of the University only seems to enhance this symbolism."
