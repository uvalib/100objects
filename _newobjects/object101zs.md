next_object: "Thomas Jefferson's #57 polygraph (copy machine)"
why: "Jefferson used it to duplicate much of his correspondence in the founding of the University of Virginia, indeed had it not existed, chances are we wouldn't know half of what we do. What would it be like if so many of Jefferson's retirement letters simply weren't there?      Not to mention that your #57 polygraph initially belonged to one of our first great artists, Charles Willson Peale....      From 1875 the polygraph was on display at the University's library, quite likely just escaping the rotunda fire of 1895. I've found a photo of the machine just a few years after the disaster.      I think they barely got it out.      The polygraph also spent years in Rouss Hall after being restored there by the much beloved A. J. Weed, physics department machinist, lecturer, and photographer before making it's way to Monticello in the late 1940s.      I would quietly argue Jefferson's polygraph is the most important thing that the University owns that isn't at UVA.  So for the 101st object, please consider sending people off-grounds to Monticello to see something that in one sense belongs not just to the university but to all of us.      #57 is a survivor: creating, documenting and surviving the great years and the tragedies of the University's every single day from slavery to fire to freedom.      I rest my case."
