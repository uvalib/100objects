why: "Often when one thinks of our University's rich history, one tends to think of the most highly regarded individuals who have walked our grounds throughout time (A.K.A. Thomas Jefferson, Edgar Allen Poe, James Madison, or James Monroe). While certainly their presence, actions, and impacts on our campus over time have created and improved some of the most enriching attributes to this University's history, I think we often times tend to take the light off of other essential figures who have impacted our Grounds throughout its history and what better way to do that than to honor the original individuals who laid the foundation for student life at the University of Virginia by adding a picture of the first ever UVA graduating class to the museum."
