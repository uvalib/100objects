next_object: "copy of portion of text of Jefferson's rough draft of the Declaration of Independence"
why: "1. The Declaration ranked with UVa, in Jefferson's own mind, as one of his crowning achievements. 2. This rough draft included Jefferson's stinging rebuke of George III over the issue of slavery. See text at https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/declara/ruffdrft.html .   The specific text of a portion removed from the final version: "...he has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. this piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce: and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, & murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them; thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another."  Many people now talk about Jefferson's "problem" with slavery. There should be a little bit dedicated to the complexities of his views and behaviors. I think this fits within the scope of the objects related to the history of UVA."
