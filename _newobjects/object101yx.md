next_object: "A picture from the concert for cville"
why: "I specifically remember that the artifact in commemoration for the protests in August 2017 had been taken down. A picture showing the unity of the community at the concert would be a good way to be able to mention the protests while also being able to put a positive unifying message alongside of it. Ideally, the picture would be of the crowd and performers (either DMB or Stevie Wonder). This was a really powerful evening and had a lasting impact on the community."
