next_object: "An 1825 College of Arts and Sciences syllabus (or the oldest that can be located)"
why: "Very few of the objects in the exhibit relate to student life at UVA, and practically none relate to the everyday experiences students have had in the classroom for the last 200 years. Displaying a historical syllabus would not only reveal the history and evolution of UVA's curriculum, but it would allow students, faculty, and alumni to connect with past generations through the most ubiquitous facet of student life within the College of Arts and Sciences: the coursework."
