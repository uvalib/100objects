why: "This autobiography by Southall is one of the grandest testaments to the lasting significance of a University of Virginia education ever written. James P.C. Southall accomplished many things in his life, including becoming President of the Optical Society of American and working for the United States War Department. In his memoir, however, he focuses almost exclusively on his time at UVa, offering invaluable insight into what it meant to be a student in the early years of this University. This book also serves as a testament to the uniqueness of a UVa education wherein students learn, above all, how to be a good person rather than just academics. It is this sense of community and values that continues to set the University of Virginia apart from its contemporaries to this day which is why this book has earned its place as the 101st Object."
